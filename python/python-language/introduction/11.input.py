# In this tutorial, we cover how to get user input. For a simple text-based
# GUI (graphical user interface), it can sometimes be useful to allow for a
# user to enter some input into the program while it runs. Using Python 3's
# "input" function, we can do that

x = input('What is your name?: ')
print('Hello',x)
