# One of the most popular uses for Python is data analysis. Naturally, data
# scientists want a way to visualize their data. Either they are wanting to
# see it for themselves to get a better grasp of the data, or they want to
# display the data to convey their results to someone. With Matplotlib,
# arguably the most popular graphing and data visualization module for Python,
# this is very simplistic to do. In this tutorial, I will be covering all of
# what I consider to be the basic necessities for Matplotlib. If you are
# interested in learning more about Matplotlib, then I highly suggest you
# visit my extensive and dedicated tutorial series on just Matplotlib.

# In order to get the Matplotlib, you should first head to Matplotlib.org and
# download the version that matches your version of Python. From there, it'd
# be wise to go ahead and make sure you have pyparsing, dateutil, six, numpy,
# and maybe some of the others mentioned in the video. You can get all of
# these as well, if you are on a Windows machine by heading to:

# six
# numpy

# python -m pip install SomePackage

# python -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4    # specific version
# python -m pip install "SomePackage>=1.0.4"  # minimum version

# python2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2
# python2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7
# python3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3
# python3.4 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 3.4

# python3 -mpip install -U matplotlib
# python3 -mpip install -U pyparsing
# python3 -mpip install -U dateutil		
# python3 -mpip install -U six
# python3 -mpip install -U numpy


# Once you have Matplotlib installed, be sure to open up a terminal or a
# script, type:

import matplotlib

# Make sure there are no errors on the import. If there are, read the error.
# Most often, either the bit version does not match (64 bit vs 32 bit), or you
# are missing a package like dateutil or pyparsing.
