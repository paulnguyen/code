    By default, Swift assigns the raw values starting at zero 
    and incrementing by one each time, but you can change this 
    behavior by explicitly specifying values. In the example above, 
    Ace is explicitly given a raw value of 1, and the rest of the 
    raw values are assigned in order. You can also use strings or 
    floating-point numbers as the raw type of an enumeration. Use 
    the rawValue property to access the raw value of an enumeration 
    case.
 
    Use the init?(rawValue:) initializer to make an instance of an 
    enumeration from a raw value. It returns either the enumeration 
    case matching the raw value or nil if there is no matching Rank.

/*
 
    If an enumeration has raw values, those values are 
    determined as part of the declaration, which means 
    every instance of a particular enumeration case 
    always has the same raw value. 
 
    Another choice for enumeration cases is to have values 
    associated with the case—these values are determined 
    when you make the instance, and they can be different 
    for each instance of an enumeration case. 
 
    You can think of the associated values as behaving like 
    stored properties of the enumeration case instance. 
 
    For example, consider the case of requesting the sunrise 
    and sunset times from a server. The server either responds 
    with the requested information, or it responds with a 
    description of what went wrong.

/*
 
    Use struct to create a structure. Structures support 
    many of the same behaviors as classes, including methods 
    and initializers. 
 
    One of the most important differences between structures 
    and classes is that structures are always copied when they 
    are passed around in your code, but classes are passed by 
    reference.
