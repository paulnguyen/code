Hello World

https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/01_introduction/01_Hello%20world

Kotlin code is usually defined in packages. Package specification is optional:
If you don't specify a package in a source file, its content goes to the
default package.
    
An entry point to a Kotlin application is the main function. In Kotlin 1.3,
you can declare main without any parameters. The return type is not specified,
which means that the function returns nothing.
    
println writes a line to the standard output. It is imported implicitly. Also
note that semicolons are optional.

package org.kotlinlang.play         

fun main() {                        
    println("Hello, World!")        
}
